st.markdown("""
**Analyse your cycling performance on any route.** Simply upload a **GPX file** (exported from Strava, Garmin, RideWithGPS, etc.) or test the tool immediately using one of the built-in demo files.

This model uses real-world physics, accounting for your power, weight, gravity and wind to predict exactly how you will perform on race day.

### Which tool should I use?

* **⏱️ Ride Time Calculator**:
    Input your power to see how fast you will ride.
    Best for answering: *"If I hold 200 Watts, what time will I finish?"*

* **⚡ Power Plan Estimator**:
    Input your target time to see the required power.
    Best for answering: *"What average wattage do I need to ride this course in 1 hour?"*

* **📈 Race Strategy Optimiser**:
    Uses a Genetic Algorithm to generate an optimised pacing plan.
    Instead of riding at a constant speed, this tool calculates exactly where to push hard and where to recover to minimize your total time.

# --- DISCLAIMER SECTION ---
with st.expander("ℹ️ Important: Read about the 'Constant Power' assumption"):
    st.markdown("""
    **1. The Assumption**
    The *Ride Time Calculator* and *Power Estimator* tools assume a **Constant Power Output**. They calculate what happens if you hold the exact same wattage for every second of the ride, never surging, never resting.

    **2. The Reality**
    Real riding is dynamic. If you generally average **100 Watts** but hit a steep gradient, you would naturally surge to **150 Watts+** to clear the obstacle.
    
    **3. The Consequence**
    Because the basic tools strictly apply your average power against gravity, they may predict a **"Stall"** (failure to finish) on steep hills if your input power is too low, even if you could physically ride them by surging.
    
    👉 **Recommendation:** For a realistic plan that accounts for surging on climbs and recovering on descents, use the **Race Strategy Optimiser**.
