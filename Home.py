**Analyse your cycling performance on any route.** Simply upload a **GPX file** (exported from Strava, Garmin, RideWithGPS, etc.) or test the tools immediately using one of the built-in demo files.

This model uses real-world physics—accounting for your power, weight, gravity, and wind—to predict exactly how you will perform on race day.

### Which tool should I use?

* **⏱️ Ride Time Calculator**
    *Input your power to see how fast you will ride.*
    Best for answering: *"If I hold 200 Watts, what time will I finish?"*

* **⚡ Power Plan Estimator**
    *Input your target time to see the required power.*
    Best for answering: *"What average wattage do I need to ride this course in 1 hour?"*

* **📈 Race Strategy Optimiser**
    *Uses a Genetic Algorithms to generate an optimised pacing plan.*
    Instead of riding at a constant speed, this tool calculates exactly where to push hard (hills) and where to recover to minimize your total time.
